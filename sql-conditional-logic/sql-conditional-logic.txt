-- Part 1: 
-- Q1: Write SQL statements to return data of the following questions:
-- In the log_feature table, write the conditional logic with the following conditions:
-- If the volume < 100, then make those records as “low”
-- If the volume between 100 and 500, then make those records as “medium”
-- If the volume > 500, then make those records as ”large”

SELECT *,
	CASE
		WHEN lf.volume < 100 THEN 'low'
		WHEN lf.volume BETWEEN 100 AND 500 THEN 'medium'
		WHEN lf.volume > 500 THEN 'large'
	END as volume_size
FROM log_feature lf;

-- Q2: From the query above, can you show the quantity of records for each “low”, “medium” and “large”?
SELECT 
	CASE
		WHEN lf.volume < 100 THEN 'low'
		WHEN lf.volume BETWEEN 100 AND 500 THEN 'medium'
		WHEN lf.volume > 500 THEN 'large'
	END as volume_1,
	COUNT(*)
FROM log_feature lf
GROUP BY volume_1;

-- Part 2: Write a conditional logic with the following conditions:
-- If “HourlyRate” is greater and equal than 80, then make the records as “high hourly rate”
-- If “HourlyRate” is between 40 and 80, then make the records as “medium hourly rate”
-- If “HourlyRate” is less than 40, then make the records as “low hourly rate”
-- Return the “EmployeeNumber”, “HourlyRate”, and the conditional logic result in the end

SELECT EmployeeNumber, HourlyRate,
	CASE 
		WHEN HourlyRate >= 80 THEN 'high hourly rate'
		WHEN HourlyRate BETWEEN 40 AND 80 THEN 'medium hourly rate'
		WHEN HourlyRate <= 40 THEN 'low hourly rate'
	END as HourlyRate_1
FROM employee;


-- Part 3: Write a conditional logic with the following conditions:
-- If “Gender” is “Female”, then make the records as an integer “0”
-- If “Gender” is “Male”, then make the records as an integer “1”
-- Return the “Gender” and the conditional logic result in the end

SELECT Gender, 
	CASE
		WHEN Gender = 'Female' THEN 0
		WHEN Gender = 'Male' THEN 1
	END as Gender_1
FROM employee;
